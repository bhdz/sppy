# sppy
sphia.org v1.2  cpython & cff binding 


status:

work in progress, you may start using it but everything is low level, currently lack of automated abstraction (like dict interface and python datamodel support )

roadmap:

    cffi method is on dev, in order to support pypy
    light & simple encoding decoding to distinguish py types in same db
    organization of project is total chaos but I implement bottom-up approach или казано на български от краката за главата it will be refactored
